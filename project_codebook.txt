Description of experiment (as described by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto)
=================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. Details are below.


Derivation of Features (as described by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto)
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

project.data.txt variables:
======================

The X_train and X_test datasets of Reyes-Ortiz et al. were combined to create one large dataset. Then the mean (_mean_) value and standard deviation (_std_) of each feature were extracted from this dataset. For each activity performed by each subject, the mean of the mean and standard deviation were calculated. Details on the data processing can be found in README.md. The variables of the dataset are listed below by column. Explanation of feature names can be found in "Derivation of Features" section. In addition to feature mean and standard deviation means, the data contains a column entitled "subject" that gives the id (1-30) of the subject measured, and a column entitled "activity" (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walkingdownstairs, walkingupstairs) that gives the name of the activity performed by the subject.
